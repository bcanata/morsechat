A mobile-friendly morse code web chat designed to learn morse and communicate with friends, without having to buy
a radio. Inspired by [@bkanker](https://twitter.com/bkanber)'s web app morsecode.me

Live demo: [halb.it/morsecode](https://halb.it/morsecode)

## important

This is a complete rewrite of the old morsechat, written using more modern web technologies.
The old codebase is archived in the 'legacy_php_morsechat' branch of this repository, and is no longer maintained.

This rewrite is not ready to go live yet, halb.it/morsecode is still serving the old php version
